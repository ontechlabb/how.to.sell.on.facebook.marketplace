Whether you are a casual seller or a Facebook merchant, here's what you need to know about how to sell on Facebook Marketplace. 

## STEP 1: SET UP OR LOG IN TO YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT

With roughly 2.89 billion monthly active Facebook users, chances are, you already have an account, so you can just log in. If you don't, go ahead and set one up. 


## STEP 2: GO TO MARKETPLACE

If you're using the browser version of Facebook, you'll find Marketplace on the menu on the left-hand side of your screen.

Mobile app users should look for the symbol with three lines in the top right-hand corner of their screen. From there, you'll be able to view the Marketplace icon. 

Once you've found the Marketplace, click on the button to create a new listing to get started. 


## STEP 3: CREATE LISTING

To begin, you will have to choose a category for your listing. The more specific you can be, the more likely a potential customer will find your post.

Additionally, when creating your listing, you can provide a title, price, description, and the availability of your item.

Make sure that your title clearly states what you're selling. Also, use the description to clarify anything that you need to about the item. You will also be able to list the condition of the item for sale (i.e. new or used).

**When creating your listing, keep the following in mind:**

Consider the demand for the product
Set a reasonable price
Include keywords in your title and description


## STEP 4: OPTION TO PUBLISH TO ADDITIONAL GROUPS


Once you're happy with your listing and press the next button, you will have the option to automatically list your item in relevant Facebook groups.

Buy and sell groups were part of Facebook long before they launched their official Marketplace in 2016. A lot of people still use them to find unique items or items in their community.


## STEP 5: PUBLISH YOUR LISTING

The final step is to simply hit “publish” on your post! This will make your post public for anyone searching on Facebook Marketplace. Congratulations, you're on your way to your first sale!
